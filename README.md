# Expressor

Expressor is a free online app to create reusable calculators based on formula expressions.

For example, you can enter `x * sqrt (y)` and then generate results based on values you set for x or y. 

It sounds like a trivial thing until you realise you have a lot of hand calculations you need to do daily, punching calculators to get the results you need (such as comparing interest rates across banks).

This project was built with React & Redux, and a good exercise in applying modern application architecture (CQRS, uni-directional data flow, etc)
