Expressor.io is a free online app to create reusable calculators. It takes in typed expressions in standard formats, for example: x * sqrt (y) and then generate results based on values you set for x or y. It sounds like a trivial thing until you realise you have a lot of hand calculations you need to do daily, punching calculators to get the results you need (such as comparing interest rates across banks).

It was a project built with React & Redux, and a good exercise in applying modern application architecture.
